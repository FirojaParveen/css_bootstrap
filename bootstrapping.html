      <h3>Weather</h3>
      <p>Weather is basically the way the atmosphere is behaving, mainly with respect to its effects upon life and human activities.</p>
      <p>In most places, weather can change from minute-to-minute, hour-to-hour, day-to-day, and season-to-season.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3>Climate</h3>
      <p>climate is the description of the long-term pattern of weather in a particular area.

Some scientists define climate as the average weather for a particular region and time period, usually taken over 30-years. It's really an average pattern of weather for a particular region.</p>
      <p>When scientists talk about climate, they're looking at averages of precipitation, temperature, humidity, sunshine, wind velocity, phenomena such as fog, frost, and hail storms, and other measures of the weather that occur over a long period in a particular place.

      <h3>Season</h3>        
      <p>Seasons are annual cyclic changes in weather patterns due to the Earth being tilted on its axis in relation to its orbital plane. The four seasons are marked by the summer and winter solstice (longest and shortest day of the year), and the spring and fall equinox (equal daylight and night). Seasons have the most contrast in the temperate zones, and the least contrast in the tropics and polar regions.</p>
      <p>Seasons are patterns in weather during a specific part of the year.</p>
